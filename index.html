<p>he World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.[1]
    Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network 
    through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. 
    Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through 
    character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).</p>
